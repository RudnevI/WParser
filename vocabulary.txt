天使|Angel, てんし|One who uses heaven to their advantage is someone from heaven, like an angel.|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
角度|Angle, かくど|The degree of the angle shows what the angle is. 90 degrees? 160 degrees? They're all still angles when you come down to it.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
発表|Announcement, はっぴょう|I'm going to express my departure. That is my only announcement.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The ひょう changes to ぴょう and the はつ gets shortened, though, so just about everything about this word is weird.

仮定|Assumption, かてい|A temporary determination is something you're not totally sure about. You've decided to think of something in a certain way, but only for now. If more information comes to light, you may change. That's why this word means assumption or hypothesis.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
通り|Avenue, とおり|You know the word 通る hopefully by now. That is the verb version of this word, which means "to pass through." So, if this is the noun version, what is it that you use to pass through something? To drive or walk along? That would be an avenue (or street, road, etc). This is a pretty common word in Japan, and good for not getting lost.|The reading is the same as the word 通る, so as long as you know that, you should be able to read this one as well. Mind the strange long お sound!
美しい|Beautiful, うつくしい|This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of beauty? It's beautiful.|Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you. It's a long reading for a mnemonic, but try your best. You look at someone who is beautiful. What an easy life they've lived. No hard work and all they do is pamper themselves to stay beautiful. Feel disgusted. You walk up to this person and say: "U too cushy! (うつくしい). Sorry for adding the whole word in there for the reading mnemonic, but I thought it worked out better that way. Just know that the word isn't うつくしいしい or something weird like that. The hiragana on the end is part of the mnemonic as well.
美人|Beautiful Woman, びじん|A beautiful person is a beautiful woman. Wait, why isn't this a beautiful person? In fact, this word used to have a broader meaning, but for some reason it's generally only used for women in modern Japanese.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
気を付けて|Be Careful, きをつけて|This word contains the words 気 (energy) and 付ける (to attach). So, when you attach energy to something you're focusing in on it, right? This word is a sort of "order" as well, since it's te-form there at the end. It's a set phrase people say to other people who are doing dangerous things. It's kind of like saying "Attach energy to what you're doing! Stay focused!" A simpler way to translate this would be to say this word means be careful or take care, though. Learn this word so that you can always show that you're caring for your friends!|The readings come from the two words 気 and 付ける. So long as you know those from the previous levels, you should be able to read this one as well.
白黒|Black And White, しろくろ|Something is both white and black. It is black and white (you can also say white and black if you prefer).|The readings are kun'yomi, but you should have seen both 白 and 黒い separately as vocabulary by now. It's the same readings here, so you can apply that knowledge and read this word!
体重|Body Weight, たいじゅう|How heavy is your body? Figure that out and you'll have your body weight.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

肉屋|Butcher Shop, にくや|A meat shop is a place that sells meat. Who sells meat? A butcher shop.|For 肉 you use the にく reading (which you learned with the kanji). For 屋 you use the kun'yomi, which you learned with the kanji. Basically, if you learned the kanji readings, you can read this word!
服|Clothes, ふく|The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.|The reading is the reading you learned with the kanji and uses the on'yomi even though it's a single word. Very strange, but convenient for you so long as you remember this exception reading word.

〜度|Degrees, ど|The kanji degree can mean both degree in terms of angles and degree in terms of temperature. This word is how you talk about these things. Just attach it to a number and you have yourself the number of degrees that something is. After the numbers 1, 2 and 3 (and in some other situations) this can also mean times.|The reading is the same as the kanji reading you learned. When writing out the answer to this reading, omit the 〜 as it's only there to let you know that some other word should come before it.
〜部|Department, ぶ|You'll see this attached to other words... like "sales" or "tennis." When you see this, you'll know it is a ___ department, or a ___ club, making this word mean department or club, similar to the kanji meaning.|The reading is the on'yomi reading.

You will go to see the unseen, and hopefully make a great discovery.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You know the はつ part, which gets shortened to はっ. The 見 is unlike what you learned with 見, though. In order to remember that this is けん, imagine you're going out to make a discovery of some strange new lands. With strange new lands, there comes strange new people. This one has a samurai named Ken けん on it. He's trying to discover new things too!
二重|Double, にじゅう|When you have two heavy things, you have double and dual the heavy (compared to one, at least). This word is a prefix attached to other words to show that it is "double." 二重 kanji time!|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
小学校|Elementary School, しょうがっこう|You've seen 学校 from a couple levels ago. Now we're adding a small to it. What is a "small school"? That's a school for small people, making it an elementary school.|The reading is the regular on'yomi reading of 小 plus the vocab word 学校 that you've seen previously. Combine these two things for the reading of 小学校.

That's exactly what it is. Just 100 degrees, not one degree more or less. You put your eggs on the street and watch them cook.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

実験|Experiment, じっけん|A test that tries to find truth is an experiment. This is because you don't know the truth, so the only way to find it is to try things out and test them. Thus, experiment!|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Take note that the つ in じつ is turned into a small っ, though.
火事|Fire, かじ|Fire is a thing that makes more fire. Basically fire is fire.|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.

Especially in Japan, very important.|The kun'yomi reading is used for the 魚 (so it's さかな) and the kun'yomi reading is used for 屋 (や). You'll have to use the reading of 魚 from the vocabulary from a couple levels ago to remember the reading of this one.
発売|For Sale, はつばい|You want things to depart from your store so you have to sell them. You put all these things up for sale. You are selling these items.|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
表|Front, おもて|This is the noun version of the kanji express. If you want to understand what something is trying to express you usually look at its front or its exterior. This word is usually used for the exterior face of buildings.|Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're standing in front of a building, staring at its front. You spend some time gazing at it before you realize what it is. "Oh, motel (おもて)", you say aloud. A little time looking at the exterior and you're able to figure it out.
家具|Furniture, かぐ|Your house tools aren't the tools you use to build a house. They're more like the things that are a part of your house that you use like tools. Those things would be your furniture. So, remember, your house tools are just furniture.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
お客さん|Guest, おきゃくさん|The さん on the end is the name honorific さん. It's there to show some respect. It's like saying "Mr. Guest!" or something like that. But that sounds dumb in English. We'll just call this word guest, visitor, or customer. You'll hear this word a lot when you're at a store or you're a customer somewhere in Japan. You are the お客さん, in that situation. Alternatively, you'll also hear お客さま which is a more polite version of this word (because it ends in さま and not さん).|The reading is the reading you learned with the kanji. Just add the hiragana on the end and you'll be good to go.
客室|Guest Room, きゃくしつ|A guest's room is the guest room (the room you put guests in, duh!).|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
ハート形|Heart Shaped, はーとがた ハートがた|ハート is of course "heart" and you know that 形 means shape. You've probably already figured this one out. It's heart shaped. You can add this kanji to all sorts of other things too to say "____ shaped." Give it a try!|The reading for the kanji portion uses the kun'yomi reading. This is kind of like the reading you already learned for 形 just without the ち part. And rendaku happens too, so it becomes がた. If you can remember that, you should be able to remember this reading too!
重い|Heavy, おもい|This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of heavy? It's also heavy.|Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're lifting something that's really heavy. Oof! You lift it above your head. You're so awesome. You scream: "OH! MORE!" (おも) they put more. You yell it again: "OH, MORE!" and again: "OH, MORE!" Go ahead and act this out wherever you are, pretending like you're holding a couch or two or three over your head, saying "OH MORE!"
高さ|Height, たかさ|You've seen the word 高い from a couple levels ago. This word is related to that. It's like 大きい versus 大きさ, where one describes the other. In this case, the 高さ is the height of something (while 高い is tall). This word isn't "price" though. For that you'd ask いくらですか？ (how much is it?).|Use the reading of 高い (たかい) to help you to learn and remember the reading for this one. They are the same with just the hiragana at the end different.
高校生|High School Student, こうこうせい|You know 高校 means "high school." So, a "life" that does high school is a high school student. This is like how 中学生 are middle school students and 小学生 are elementary school students!|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Use the reading of 高校 from before to learn the reading of this word as well, if it helps.
家事|Housework, かじ|The only action you should be doing in my house is the housework and my chores. This isn't a hotel. Get moving! Clean my dishes!|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
何度|How Many Times, なんど|If someone asks you what occurrence or what degrees they're really trying to ask you how many times something happened. Sometimes they're asking what temperature it is too.|The reading is a combination of kun'yomi and on'yomi readings. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned already, so you should be able to read this.
大事|Important, だいじ|A big action means something big is going down. This is no ordinary action. It is an action that is important.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
和風|Japanese Style, わふう|The Japanese style style. The Japanese often like to think they're very unique and have a very special kind of style (and often times they do). So, you'll hear this word used when someone wants to describe this unique sense of style. Wafuuuu! Note that this word uses alternative kanji meanings in both of the kanji. They're in the kanji explanation, but they're not the primaries, so it may take a little extra effort to learn this word depending on what you studied!|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
和服|Japanese Style Clothes, わふく|Japanese style clothes (Japanese Style Clothes). We're talking kimonos and yukata and things like that. Basically, this differentiates Japanese clothing from Western clothing. What kind of clothes will you wear to the festival tonight? Oh, probably some 和服.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
和食|Japanese Style Food, わしょく|Japanese style eat ... well, let's change "eat" to "food" and you have Japanese style food. This is a good way to differentiate between an American style restaurant and a Japanese style restaurant. What kind of food you feeling like tonight? Oh, how about some 和食?|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
和室|Japanese Style Room, わしつ|A Japanese style room tends to be pretty small. This mainly refers to the kind of room that's covered in tatami mats, though. If you're looking for places to stay in Japan, a 和室 will be something like that. You'll pull the futon out of the closet and sleep on the floor. So comfy, these Japanese style rooms!|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
仮名|Kana, かな|The temporary names. These are the kana (that's hiragana and katakana). Why are the "temporary names" kana, though? Perhaps they were never meant to be a main way to write the names of the kanji... They are just a temporary way to write the name of kanji you don't know how to write the "correct" way (aka kanji)? That's just a guess, but it should help you to remember that this word means "kana," at least.|The reading for 仮 is the one you learned with the kanji. The 名 portion is not, however, and uses its kun'yomi reading (な), which you saw with the kanji 名 (な). How to remember all this, though? Think of it this way: The people who made kanji really don't want you to know kana. It's bad for business. They want anyone who uses the word "kana" to suffer, so they decided to make one part on'yomi and another part kun'yomi. Don't let them get you!
生保|Life Insurance, せいほ|A Life guarantee is something you get on someone else. If their life ends, it's guaranteed with money. That's a life insurance policy, for yah! (A.K.A. life assurance in some parts of the world!)|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
生物|Living Thing, せいぶつ|A life thing is a living thing, a creature, or an organism.|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
名物|Local Specialty, めいぶつ|The famous thing of an area is their famous product, but it sounds better in English if you say it's the local specialty. When you're traveling around Japan, be sure to be on the lookout for the 名物! It's always fun.|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
要点|Main Point, ようてん|The needed point is the main point. It's the gist of what you're trying to say.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
勝負|Match, しょうぶ|Win, lose... both will happen in tonight's match! What a showdown it will be!|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

中学校|Middle School, ちゅうがっこう|You know that 学校 means school. So, people who are in the middle school are in... wait for it... middle school. And, of course, if you're one of those people that call it junior high school you can do that too.|The reading is a combination of 学校 and 中. Really, it's all on'yomi too, so you should be able to read this one. Take note of the がく turning to がっ, though.
名古屋|Nagoya, なごや|The place that's famous for old roofs. I don't know why, but it's the city of Nagoya. Just associate the two things together and it'll be hard to forget (so long as you've heard of Nagoya before - if not, read up about it!).|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji (except for 名 and 屋, which are kun'yomi here). If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. For な just think to 名前 (なまえ) which uses the な reading. The "name" (名前) of this city is what? It's Nagoya. Watch out for rendaku changing こ to ご too.
必要|Necessary, ひつよう|It's certain that you need it. This thing is necessary. It is needed.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
付近|Neighborhood, ふきん|If you attach things near you, they end up being in the same neighborhood as you. They're attached nearby so they can't go much further.|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for 付 though, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Your neighborhood is full of fools (ふ). Fools everywhere. You're probably one too, since you live nearby.
新しい|New, あたらしい|This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of new? It's new.|Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Your family buys you a new Atari! You're so excited! But wait... what's this? This is no Atari. This is an Atara... a knockoff video game system :(
新年|New Year, しんねん|A new year is a new year. Hope you had / have / are having a good one, depending on when you read this.|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
苦しい|Painful, くるしい|This word ends in い, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. The kanji 苦 means suffering, so what could a related adjective be? This word means painful or agonizing.|Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Everything is really painful right now. Why? You have something heavy on top of you, crushing (くる) you.
相手|Partner, あいて|Your mutual hand is someone else's hands (or just someone else, if you remembered that 手 can also refer to a person as well). Whose hands are these? These are your partner's hands. That's why everything is mutual.|The readings are the kun'yomi readings. For 手, that's no problem for you. For 相, that's more of an issue since you learned the on'yomi reading for it. Think of it this way: Your partner wouldn't be your partner without you. Your partner is: I (あい) and you. Remember that as you gaze into your partner's eyes. "I and you."
平和|Peace, へいわ|The flat peace. This is a peace that will last, because there's no waves... no ripples... just flat. This is plain old peace.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

〜県|Prefecture, けん|Attach this word onto the end of a prefecture place name and you have the prefecture portion of _____ prefecture. These are a lot like states or provinces.|The reading for this is the same as what you learned with the kanji, probably because it's always attached to things (so it's like jukugo). Don't write the 〜 when you're writing in the answer, just the けん portion, and you'll get this one correct.
発音|Pronunciation, はつおん|The sound that departs from your mouth is you talking. Imagine yourself saying things and words departing your mouth. They are bent in different ways and have different colors, highlighting your pronunciation of certain words and phrases.|This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
部首|Radical, ぶしゅ|Picture the part of your body that makes up your neck. Are you picturing it? That's a building block that makes up your body. A really important one. If you didn't have that neck, you wouldn't look like a person at all. Sound familiar? It should! Because that part of your neck is a radical! Just like part of your neck is a building block of your body, the radical is a building block of kanji. Get it? I sure hope so!|This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for 首 yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you need a radical to make a new kanji, you just press a button and the radical comes tumbling down the radical chute (しゅ).

部屋|Room, へや|If you have a part of a roof, that part is your room. Just imagine a roof divided into sections in a house, with the sections going all the way down to the ground. Each section is its own room, right?|The reading is kind of an exception. The 屋 is normal (や) but the 部 is weird. It is へ. Just imagine that you rent out a room and the only one they have is just the hay (へ) room in the barn, so you sleep there for the night. Imagine the smell of hay and how scratchy it is to sleep in this room.

世界|The World, せかい|The generations (and society!) that make up the world create our world.

Like the kanji, this word has to do with action things... things that you do, for example, rather than physical things.|Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading.

Why did you do it? You knew that feisty wolverine was going to eat your coat (こと).
今度|This Time, こんど|In the now occurrence you'll learn your kanji, no? This word means this time. Despite being "this time" it has the feeling of next time, though.

If you know that word's reading you should be able to figure out this word's reading as well (and vice versa).
曲がる|To Be Bent, まがる|This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means both music and bend. In the case of this word, we're looking at "bend." So, the verb form of bend is to be bent. This is when something bends on its own, not when you're doing the bending. It's just bending.|Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Something, let's say a road, starts out straight. But, with some magic, a witch causes it to curve.
欠ける|To Be Lacking, かける|This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means lack, and this verb has several meanings related to that. It can mean to be lacking, like "imagination is really lacking in this movie." It can also mean to not be present, like when you realize your Japanese teacher is missing. When talking about something like a tea cup or your teeth, it can mean to get chipped. I guess if you chip a teapot it is lacking in...perfection?|Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Something is lacking... it's a car (か).

Imagine the sweat... the pain... the thirst... all because that car's not present.
表す|To Express, あらわす|This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.

Sorry, had to be expressed.
見付ける|To Find, みつける|You know that 付ける means "to attach" and that 見 means "see." So, when you attach your seeing to something, it's like you're looking around trying to find something.

And then that mold will cover your hand, then your arm, then your entire body. Basically, you should never hold anything for too long or you'll become a mold person.
交わる|To Intersect, まじわる|You know that the kanji means mix and the word 交ぜる means "to mix," so it probably has something to do with that. This word means to intersect, which is kind of like mixing. When two things intersect with each other, they're getting mixed up, so that's where this word gets its meaning. To remember that this one means "to intersect," remember the わ as walk. You're walking around, and then you intersect with some people on the street.|The reading is almost the same as 交ぜる which you should be familiar with by now. It has the ま but it also has an extra じ in there. That じ is there because you intersect with a group of mages (まじ) that catch you on fire as you walk past.
通す|To Let Something Pass, とおす|This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that 通る means to pass, but this is a little different. You aren't the one passing, Sue (す) is. So you have to let Sue pass. In other words, this verb is transitive, meaning it has an object. That's why it means to let something pass or to put something through. The way this verb is translated into English changes a lot depending on the noun it's paired with. For example 火を通す is literally "to let the fire pass through", and means "to heat through". 針に糸を通す is literally "to put thread through a needle", so means "to thread a needle".|Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

Who's there to comfort you? Your Ma (ま). She's a nice lady.
要る|To Need, いる|Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means need and the verb vocab version is to need.|Since the reading isn't like the one you learned, think about what you are going to need... like, what you're really going to need, more than anything. Then, think of an eagle, because you really need an eagle. You'll need to come up with the reason why you need an eagle though, so hopefully it's a good one.

By the way, you better say ukelele the correct way, like "ooh kay lay lay," not the Anglicized way!
返す|To Return, かえす|This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means return so the verb version means to return.

You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have to return the Car egg (かえ) you found on the side of the road.

Just remember, only weak bugs use kun'yomi, and that weak bug is you in this instance.
弱々しい|Weak Looking, よわよわしい|Something that is double weak is probably pretty weak. You also know that this is an adjective because it ends with い. You know that 弱い is weak, so it probably isn't that. Instead, this one is weak looking or frail. If you know the grammar らしい you can kind of use that as a hint. The しい on the end reminds me of らしい which is like "seems to be."
