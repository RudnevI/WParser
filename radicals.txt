反|Anti|This radical is the same as the kanji. It means anti.
聿|Brush|It's easier to imagine if you turn your head sideways. The left side of this radical is the brush. See all the bristles?
阝|Building|This radical looks like a curvy letter B. What does B stand for? Building! This radical is used in a lot of kanji to mark that it's a building, or that it has something to do with buildings.
needs attention|Cleat|There's the bottom of the shoe and the spikes coming out of it. Only one kind of shoe is like this, and that is a cleat.
咅|Clown|Clowns do weird tricks. One trick they might do is stand on their mouth (or stand on someone else's mouth). Imagine a clown doing either one of these things to remember this radical: clown.
疋|Coat Rack|See all the arms sticking out of this radical? Those are for hanging lots of hats and scarves and coats on because it's a coat rack.
正|Correct|This radical is the same as the kanji. It means correct.
永|Eternity|A drop of water will last for an eternity. Do you remember learning about the water cycle in school? A single drop of water can recycle itself this way for all eternity!
needs attention|Gladiator|Someone shoved horns down onto your husband and said he has to fight for them now. They turned him into a gladiator! Now your husband has to fight for their amusement. Oh no!
重|Heavy|This radical is made up of a thousand villages. If you tried to lift them, what would it be? Heavy! And probably crazy. But just remember how heavy a thousand villages would be.
覀|Helicopter|This radical looks like a helicopter coming straight at you, doesn't it? You can't see the tail part because it's behind the bigger front cab of the helicopter. But you can see the windows and the big spinning blade on top from here.
史|History|A mouth that's talking about treasure... that sounds more like ancient history to me. Just because there was treasure buried all over the place back in history, doesn't mean it wasn't found by now. Don't let history take over your life, like it has the person who owns this mouth.
介|Jammed In|This radical kind of looks like an arrow, but not an ordinary one. It's curvy and forced, right? Like it's trying to tell you something is being jammed in to wherever it's pointing.
台|Machine|This radical is the same as the kanji. It means machine.
needs attention|Pope|Someone has crosses for eyes. That would have to be a really devout Catholic. Who's number one in that field? That would be the Pope.
辛|Spicy|You're standing up on top of a cross. Why? Because you ate something so spicy that it caused you to beg Jesus for mercy. You need to save your mouth from the spicy flames. To make sure he hears you, you stand up on the closest cross. Make sure to feel how spicy this is in your mouth to remember it better!
needs attention|Spring|This radical looks like some new plants pushing their way up and out of the soil. That's because this is the spring radical. Spring is the season (and the radical) full of new, growing life!
needs attention|Squid|See the squid shape here? There's its head, its body, and its tentacles (two, anyway). Pretty squid-like if you ask me!
癶|Tent|Kind of a strange tent, I'll admit, but one that will protect you from things trying to get in (that's why it has all the spikes). It's the best you can do, considering you're in a cloth/plastic building.
needs attention|Yurt|There's a canopy with a little table and seats inside. This is a yurt! It may look like a canopy at first, but when you go inside it has a bunch of nice furniture for you to relax on.
